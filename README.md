## üöÄ Getting Started

For detailed setup instructions, please refer to the individual README files:
- [Backend Documentation](https://github.com/PedroBolson/ecommerce-pets/blob/dev/backend/README.md)
- [Frontend Documentation](https://github.com/PedroBolson/ecommerce-pets/blob/dev/frontend/README.md)

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PedroBolson/ecommerce-pets.git
   cd ecommerce-pets
   ```

2. Set up the database:
    ```bash
    # Import the database dump into your PostgreSQL instance
    # You can find the SQL dump file in the DATA/dumps directory
    psql -U your_username -d your_database_name -f DATA/dumps/database_dump.sql
    ```

3. Set up the backend:
    ```bash
    cd backend  
    npm install  
    #Configure your .env file (see backend README for an example)
    npm run start:dev
    ```  

4. Set up the frontend:
    ```bash
    #In another terminal
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev # On dev environment already set for localhost API, for external API use .env file for front too
    ```

## üåê Deployment

This project was designed for AWS deployment. For local testing:
- Create PostgreSQL database locally
- Configure environment variables in backend/.env
- Update CORS settings to use localhost instead of AWS URLs

## üìä Project Architecture

The project follows a modern web architecture:
- **Frontend:** Single-page application with component-based structure
- **Backend:** Modular API with clear separation of concerns (controllers, services, entities)
- **Database:** Relational database with well-defined entity relationships
- **Authentication:** JWT-based auth with role-based access control
